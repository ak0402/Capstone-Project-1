<p align="Center"><h1>Ticket Selling Website's Analysis</h1>

<h2>
<b>Overview:</b></h2>

If you are planning on going out to see a movie, how well can you trust online reviews and ratings? Especially if the same company showing the rating also makes money by selling movie tickets. Do they have a bias towards rating movies higher than they should be rated?

<h2>
<b>Goal:</b></h2>

Our goal is to complete the analysis based off the 538 article and see if we reach a similar conclusion. We will need to use our pandas and visualization skills to determine if the Website's ratings in 2015 had a bias towards rating movies better to sell more tickets. </br>
